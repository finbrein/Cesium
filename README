Cesium v 0.2
============

To make, ensure that you have Boehm's GC and the latest LLVM installed on your machine.

You may need to adjust some paths in the makefile.

Now just type make.

To run it just type:

./cs

It accepts:

1) strings: "hello"
2) booleans: true false
3) integers: -12345
4) doubles: 1.23 1.23e-20

You can do computations with: 

1) doubles, integers and booleans
2) +, -, *, /, %, <<, >> and parentheses.
3) &, |, ^|, ~
4) <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
5) &&, ||, !
6) i++, i--, ++i, --i
7) i+=c, i-=c, i*=c, i/=c, i%=c
8) i&=c, i|=c, i^|=c
9) i<<=c, i>>=c

var i = 1.2, j = 2.2, k = i + j - i*j;

etc.

The following control flow expressions are valid:

1) if (bool_expr) stmt1 
2) if (bool_expr) stmt1 ; (useful at the top level)
3) if (bool_expr) stmt1 else stmt2
4) while (bool_expr) stmt1
5) { stmt; ... }

The file "tests" gives a lot of examples of things you can (and can't) do.

Note there are no typeclass checks at the moment. Things like "string"+"more"; typecheck fine, but then just crash. This will be fixed eventually.

Watch this space for updates.
