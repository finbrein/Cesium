Cesium v 0.2
============

To make, ensure that you have Boehm's GC and the latest LLVM installed on your machine.

You may need to adjust some paths in the makefile.

Now just type make.

To run it just type:

./cs

You can't do much at the moment. It will (Hindley-Milner) type check various expressions such as

var i, j = 1;
j + 2;

and so on, and reject others:

var i, j = i;
var i = 1, j = 1.2, k = i + j;

etc.

You can also do computations with doubles and integers involving +, - and parentheses.

123 + 23 - (1 + 27);
12.3 + 12.1 - (1.2 + 0.1);

etc.

Watch this space for updates.
